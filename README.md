## Spotify Genre classifier 
This project built a genre classifier over the spotify million song dataset. At first I fed the models raw unstructured data to get an idea about how accuracy and classification metrices showed performance.After that i used hyperparameter tuning to check if the individual metrics show improvement. In conclusion only the Random Forest classifier showed satisfactory results. Because of the similarities in genres the prediction accuracy got a serious hit in kNN and logistic regression models.
